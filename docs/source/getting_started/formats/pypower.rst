PYPOWER
--------

AMS includes `PYPOWER cases <https://github.com/CURENT/ams/tree/develop/ams/cases/pypower>`_
in version 2 for dispatch modeling and analysis. PYPOWER cases follow the same format as MATPOWER.

The PYPOWER case is defined as a Python dictionary that includes ``bus``, ``gen``, ``branch``,
``areas``, and ``gencost``.
Defines the PYPOWER case file format.

A PYPOWER case file is a Python file or MAT-file that defines or returns a dict named ``ppc``, referred to
as a "PYPOWER case dict". The keys of this dict are ``bus``, ``gen``, ``branch``, ``areas``, and
``gencost``.
With the exception of C{baseMVA}, a scalar, each data variable is an array, where a row corresponds
to a single bus, branch, gen, etc. The format of the data is similar to the PTI format described in
`PTI Load Flow Data Format <http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/formats/pti.txt>`_.

Version Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two versions of the PYPOWER case file format. The current
version of PYPOWER uses version 2 of the PYPOWER case format
internally and includes a ``version`` field with a value of ``2`` to make
the version explicit. Earlier versions of PYPOWER used the version 1
case format, which defined the data matrices as individual variables,
as opposed to keys of a dict. Case files in version 1 format with
OPF data also included an (unused) ``areas`` variable. While the version 1
format has now been deprecated, it is still handled automatically by
``loadcase`` and ``savecase`` which are able to load and save case files in both
version 1 and version 2 formats.

See also doc for `idx_bus`, `idx_brch`, `idx_gen`, `idx_area` and `idx_cost`
regarding constants which can be used as named column indices for the data
matrices. Also described in the first three are additional results columns
that are added to the bus, branch, and gen matrices by the power flow and OPF
solvers.

The case dict also allows for additional fields to be included.
The OPF is designed to recognize fields named ``A``, ``l``, ``u``, ``H``, ``Cw``,
``N``, ``fparm``, ``z0``, ``zl``, and ``zu`` as parameters used to directly extend
the OPF formulation (see doc for `opf` for details). Other user-defined fields may
also be included and will be automatically loaded by the ``loadcase`` function
and, given an appropriate 'savecase' callback function (see doc for
`add_userfcn`), saved by the ``savecase`` function.

Generator Cost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   If ``gen`` has ``ng`` rows, then the first ``ng`` rows of ``gencost`` contain
   the cost for active power produced by the corresponding generators.
   If ``gencost`` has :math:`2 \times ng` rows then rows :math:`ng + 1` to :math:`2 \times ng`
   contain the reactive power costs in the same format.

#.  ``startup``, startup cost in US dollars
#.  ``shutdown``, shutdown cost in US dollars
#.  ``N``, number of cost coefficients to follow for polynomial cost function,
    or number of data points for piecewise linear.
    The following parameters define the total cost function ``f(p)``,
    where units of ``f`` and ``p`` are $/hr and MW (or MVAr), respectively.

    -  For MODEL = 1: ``p0, f0, p1, f1, ..., pn, fn``
       where ``p0 < p1 < ... < pn`` and the cost ``f(p)`` is defined by
       the coordinates ``(p0,f0), (p1,f1), ..., (pn,fn)`` of the
       end/break-points of the piecewise linear cost function.
    -  For MODEL = 2: ``cn, ..., c1, c0``

       starting with the highest order, where cost is
       :math:`f(p) = c_n \times p^n + \ldots + c_1 \times p + c_0`.


Area (deprecated)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   This data is not used by PYPOWER and is no longer necessary for version 2 case files with OPF data.

#.  ``i``, area number
#.  ``price_ref_bus``, reference bus for that area
