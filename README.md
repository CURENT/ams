# Why AMS

With the built-in interface with dynamic simulation engine, ANDES, AMS enables Dynamics Interfaced Stability Constrained Production Cost and Market Operation Modeling.

AMS produces credible dispatch results and competitive performance.
The following results show the comparison of DCOPF between AMS and other tools.
