## Why AMS

### Dispatch-dynamic co-simulation

With the built-in interface with dynamic simulation engine, LTB ANDES, AMS enables Dynamics Interfaced Stability Constrained Production Cost and Market Operation Modeling.

### Rapid prototyping

New device and new formulation.

### Unified design with ANDES

The APIs are designed to be universal with ANDES, reduce the learning cost for the researchers who are interested in cross-domains.
