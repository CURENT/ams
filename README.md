# AMS

***AMS is under early development stage***.

AMS is an open-source packages for dispatch modeling and co-simulation with dynanic.

AMS is still under DEVELOPMENT, stay tuned!

## Why AMS

### Dispatch-dynamic co-simulation

With the built-in interface with open-source dynamic simulation engine, LTB ANDES, AMS enables Dynamics Interfaced Stability Constrained Production Cost and Market Operation Modeling.

### Rapid prototyping

New device or new formulation.

### Unified design with ANDES

Low learning cost.

The API is designed to be universal with ANDES, reduce the learning cost for the researchers who are interested in cross-domains.
